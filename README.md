# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2025 in Haskell.

Puzzle inputs should be stored in `inputs/` with the format `Day[Number].txt` (e.g. `DayOne.txt`).

To run the code for all days (this may be slow), execute the following command.

```bash
cabal run aoc2025
```

To run the code for a specific day, execute the following command.

```bash
cabal run aoc2025 [day] 
# e.g. cabal run aoc2025 1
```
